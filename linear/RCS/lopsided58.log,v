lopsided upright figure in an octagon with a pentagonal polygonal hull
The log file for the cplex, with ExSquander and ExScores changed
to 10.12, -6.83 (for pent), -7.83 (for others)
ExSquander= {0,0,0,0,10.12,10.12,10.12,11.668};
ExScores  = {0,0,0,0,-6.83,-7.83,-7.83,-7.83};
No cases of interest here.
