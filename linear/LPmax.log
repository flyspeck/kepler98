LPm[784,"-dih{1}8"] <  -3.604. So not convex.
LPm[784,"y(8,3)"] < 2.5091,
LPm[784,"y(8,9)"] < 2.309,
Pivot v8 around v13 stretching (v8,v3) and (v8,v9).  By the
estimates these edges never stretch out to 2T.  So eventually
a diagonal (v8,vX) in the pentagon forms, reducing this pentagon
case to a quadrilateral case.

These imply by intervals that y(2,3) < 2.82 (Hyp)
Break off (1,2,3) for a separate squander bound.

R(3,1) = 0.0155 (see case 2 of Theorem 6.3.1).

The flat quarter squanders > 0.029 = 0.0135+R(3,1),  (Hyp)
pent squanders > 0.0135 + t5 = 0.0135 + 0.076 = 0.0895 > 0.0848, done.

(Sean does though by excess T-count.)

The figure is not convex.  Use the deformation lemma for
faces to stretch edge (v10,v13). (Pivot v13 around v12.)
All other cases have been done at this point.  Eventually
the graph changes by a new edge forming or (v10,v13) stretches
beyond 2T.  So we reduce to a case already done.
