<p>
There is also a directory (countdown/numerical/OCT/)
that contains the C code that generated the list of cases
(using cplex & cfsqp).

<p>
This directory (countdown/interval/PART3OCT)
contains the files that were used in connection
with Sphere Packings III, Proposition 4.2,  octahedral inequalities.
Many of the files in this directory are related to 18 six-dimensional
inequalities that stem from a single quad cluster inequality that
was eventually discarded.  These files no longer serve any purpose.


<p>
The main C file is 
<a href="part3o.cc">part3o.cc</a>.  It belongs in the parent directory.
It generates the interval verifications.

<p>
<a href="part3o.out1">part3o.out1</a>
 is a key file containing the output obtained in 138 hours
	of computer calculations, verifying all but 18 cases.
	All of the 18 cases relate to a single quad cluster inequality,
		which has been discarded.
	Some of them spilled over into 
<a href="part3o.out2">part3o.out2</a>

<p>
The files part18.cc belong in the "cfsqp" numerical directory.
<UL>
	<LI>part18.cc is a test of the 18 final cases.

	<LI>part18.out is the output.
		I also produced the output using just one (or none) of
		the constraints.  This is part18.out.none, part18.out....
		It shows which constraints can be relaxed.

	<LI>The file part18.cc is not needed because it relates to a discarded
	inequality.  It was made from part3o.ineqlist, which lists
		the 18 final octahedral inequalities in a form that
		is easy to convert to numerical code for testing the
		inequalities.  This data has been turned into 10 digit doubles,
		so it has to be cleaned up before it is used as part of a 
		rigorous calculation.

	<LI>part3o.fail is a more extensive version of the final 18 cases.
		(It is not needed because it relates to a discarded inequality.)
		It actually contains 28 cases, of which 10 have an empty domain.

<p>
part3o.outCheck checks that the cases cover all possibilities.

<p>
part3oDataSupp.cc contains the next pass, designed to do the 18 cases.
part3o.out18bak, part3o.out18 is the output.   This
is a deadend. Do not pursue this line.
