This clock counts down to the date of expected completion.
<p>
It was set in motion on October 12, 1997. On that day, the
remaining parts of the Kepler conjecture were divided up into
27,000 credits.   A rough guess was made of the difficulty of
each step, and the credits were divided accordingly.
<p>
The project completion date is computed by the formula
<PRE>
  completionDate = startingDate + 
	(earnedCredits/totalCredits)*
		(currentDate-startingDate)
</PRE>
This will underestimate the actual completion date because the
easiest tasks will tend to be completed first.
