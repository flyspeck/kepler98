In a booklet published in 1611, J. Kepler described the
arrangement of equal spheres into the family cannonball arrangement.
He asserted that
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	The packing will be the tightest possible, so that in no other
 arrangement could more pellets be stuffed into the same container.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
This assertion has come to be known as the Kepler conjecture.  It
has gone centuries without rigorous proof.  At the international
congress of mathematicians in 1900, Hilbert proposed a list of
problems to the international community.   He included the Kepler
conjecture in the 18th problem.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
How can one arrange most densely in space an infinite
       number of equal solids of given form, e.g.,
spheres with given radii..., that is,
how can one so fit them together that the ratio of the filled
       to the unfilled space may be as great as possible?
    (Hilbert's Problem 18, part C, 1900).
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>
There are actually infinitely many ways to pack spheres with
the same density as the face-centered cubic packing.  The
face-centered cubic is obtained by stacking triangle plates of spheres
upon each other.  The plates can be shifted to produce different
packings without affecting the density.  

<p>
Various mathematicians have established upper bounds on the
density of packings in three dimensions.

The density of the face-centered cubic is pi/sqrt(18), or approximately
0.74048049.

<LI>It gives a new application of interval arithmetic.
		(The <a href="http://cs.utep.edu/interval-comp/bubble.html">
			double bubble problem</a> is another problem solved by
			interval computations.)
	<p>
<LI><EMP>It strengthens the ties between two branches of mathematics,
	Discrete Geometry and Global Optimization.  </EMP>
	<p>
	<font size=2>
	Although many problems
	in discrete geometry are quite obviously optimization problems,
	and although global optimization often relies on techniques from
	discrete geometry, the use of algorithms in global optimization
	to solve problems in discrete geometry is surprisingly uncommon.
	There should be a major superhighway between these two branches
	of mathematics rather than a few well-worn mountain trails.
	If we solve not one, but twenty or thirty problems like the Kepler
	conjecture using methods of Global Optimization,  the general
	patterns leading to this superhighway should emerge.  The Kepler
	conjecture is one piece of this large enterprise.

<LI> <EMP>We obtain a better understanding of finite dimensional models
	of infinite dimensional optimization problems. </EMP> 
	<p>
	<font size=2>
	The Kepler
	conjecture is a statement about asymptotic densities of packings
	with infinitely many spheres.  To use computers to solve the problem
	a good finite dimensional model of the problem must be constructed.
	It has been believed ever since L. Fejes T&oacute;th's fundamental
	work on sphere packings that finite dimensional models exist.
	However, the construction of a computationally accessible model
	is amazingly difficult.
	Without question, this is the single most difficult step in the 
	solution of
	the Kepler conjecture.
