<p>

The countdown clock started at 874120205 Unix Time.
At that time a list was made of all that remained, and 
27000 credits were allocated among the items, 
according to the perceived difficulty
of the item.  The clock estimates completion date by a linear extrapolation
from the starting date.  The distribution follows.

<UL>
<LI>Part III (9000 credits available).
	<UL>
	<LI>(1000) completion of a
			final draft of III with clearly stated hypotheses
			for unfinished material.
	<LI>(1000) numerical testing of the stated hypotheses of III
	<LI>(3000) rigorous verification of hypotheses stated in the paper.
	<LI>(1000) numerical testing of the 18 remaining cases.
	<LI>(3000) the 18 remaining cases, including the numerical

<LI>Final Cases of Part IV (10000 credits available)

	</UL>
</UL>

The credits were determined by the perceived difficulty of completing
each part of the Kepler conjecture.  Of course, as things progress,
our judgements of the difficulty will change, but the credit allocations
will remain the same, making some credits more difficult to earn than
others.
