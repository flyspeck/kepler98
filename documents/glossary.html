<DT>
anchor
<dd>
A vertex v is said to be the anchor of the diagonal of a quarter, if its
distance is at most 2.51 from both endpoints of the the upright diagonal.

<p><DT><B>C<dd></B>


<DT>
circumradius
<dd>  The circumradius of a triangle is given by Heron's
formula.  If the edges of the triangle are a,b,c, then eta(a,b,c)
denotes the circumradius.
<p>
The circumradius of a simplex is given by formula I.8.X.  The
circumradius of a simplex S is denoted rad(S).

<DT>
close neighbors 
<dd>Two vertices are close neighbors if their distance
from each other is no greater than 2.51.

<DT>compression 
<dd> The compression is a local measure of the tightness
of a packing.  Greater compression corresponds to a greater local
density.  If <IT>S</IT> is a simplex, we define the compression of <IT>S</IT>
to be
<PRE>
	Gamma(S) = -doct Vol(S) +sum_{i=1}^4sol(S)/3
</PRE>
where
	Vol(S) is the volume of the simplex <IT>S</IT>, and 
	sum sol(S)
is the sum of the solid angles at each of the vertices.

<DT>
cone 
<dd> If X is a set in three space, the cone C(X) over X is the
set of all nonnegative scalar multiples of vectors in X.

<DT>
Delaunay decomposition
<dd>  Begin with a saturated packing.  The Delaunay
decomposition is a partition of space into (Delaunay) simplices with vertices
at the sphere centers.  It is characterized by the property that
if a circumscribing sphere is drawn around any of the simplices, then
the interior of the circumscribing sphere contains none of the
centers of the spheres in the packing.  The Delaunay decomposition
is dual to the Voronoi decomposition: four sphere centers form a 
simplex if and only if there is a vertex of a Voronoi cell whose
closest sphere centers are those four points.
<p>
In degenerate arrangements of spheres (such as the fcc and hcp packings), 
we do not obtain a well-defined decomposition.  In this case, perturb
the sphere centers so that they are in generic position, draw the
Delaunay decomposition, and then snap the sphere centers back into
place.
<p>
The Delaunay decomposition has the following intuitive interpretation.
Imagine that space, rather than being flat, is a 3-sphere of large
radius sitting in 4-space.  Take the convex hull in 4-space of the
sphere centers.  If the sphere centers are in generic position, each
face of the hull is a simplex.  These are the simplices of the
Delaunay decomposition.

<DT>
Delaunay star 
<dd> Obsolete notion, see Decomposition star.


<DT>
delta
<dd>
delta(x1,...,x6) is a polynomial in 6 variables defined by formula
I.8.1.1.  If x1,...,x6 are the squares of the edge lengths of a simplex.
then sqrt(delta(x1,..,x6))/12 is the volume of the simplex.


<DT>
diagonal
<dd>
The longest edge of a quarter is said to be a diagonal.

<DT>
dihedral angle 
<dd> Every simplex is assumed to be equipped with an
ordering on the edges y1,...y6.  The dihedral angle of a simplex then
refers to the dihedral angle along the first edge. Dihedral
angles are measured in radians.  dih(S) denotes the dihedral angle
of the simplex S.

<DT>
dimension reduction
<dd>
Some of the interval calculations performed by computer have such
high dimension that they are difficult to prove directly.  An argument
present in I.8.7 shows how to reduce the dimension of the problem
to make it easier to prove by computer.

<DT>
Dirichlet region
<dd>
See Voronoi cell

<DT>doct 
<dd>is the constant (pi-4atan(sqrt(2))/sqrt(8), or 
approximately 0.72093.
This constant is to the octahedron what Rogers's density is to the
tetrahedron.  Specifically, take a regular octahedron of edge length
2 and volume v=8 sqrt(2)/3.  Place a ball of radius 1 at each
vertex of the octahedron, and let s be the part of the volume
of these balls inside the octahedron.
doct= s/v.

<p><DT><B>E<dd></B>

<DT>
enclosed vertex
<dd>
A vertex is enclosed over a standard region if it is contained
in the interior of the cone over standard region.

<DT>
eta(y1,y2,y3)
<dd>
The circumradius of a triangle whose edges have lengths y1,y2,y3.

<p><DT><B>F<dd></B>

<DT>
flat quarter
<dd>
If a quarter has a distinguished vertex, it is said to be flat
when the three edges meeting at the distinguished vertex have lengths
between 2 and 2.51.

<p><DT><B>G<dd></B>

<DT>
Gamma
<dd>See compression

<p><DT><B>H<dd></B>

<DT>
height
<dd>
The height of a vertex is its distance from the origin.

<p><DT><B>M<dd></B>

<DT>
method of subdivision
<dd>Although this term is not standard, it refers to a standard
procedure in interval arithmetic of breaking the domain of a function
into smaller regions as needed to produce good bounds on the
range of a function over a given domain.

<p><DT><B>N<dd></B>

<p><DT><B>O<dd></B>

<DT>
overlap
<dd>
Two sets overlap if their relative interiors intersect.

<DT>
octahedron (quasi-regular)  
<dd>An octahedron is quasi-regular if
each edge has length between 2 and 2.51 and some diagonal has
length between 2.51 and sqrt(8).

<p><DT><B>P<dd></B>

<DT>
pentagonal prism
<dd>  The pentagonal prisms are a special family of
decomposition stars that come uncomfortably close to providing
counterexamples to the decomposition star approach to the Kepler
conjecture.  In fact, the pentagonal prisms are actual counterexamples
to the earliest formulation of the Kepler conjecture with
Delaunay stars.  One of the major steps in the proof of the Kepler
conjecture is to show that pentagonal prisms score less than the
decomposition stars of the close packings.  Detailed information
about decomposition stars can be found in Ferguson's thesis.

<DT>
point  
<dd>A point (abbreviated pt) is by definition the constant
<PRE>
-pi/3 + 4 atan(sqrt(2)/5).
</PRE>
It is equal to the compression of
a regular tetrahedron of edge length 2.   Its significance comes from
the formulation of the Kepler conjecture as an optimization problem
in finitely many variables.  Often the scores of decomposition stars
are measured in multiples of points because these numbers tend to
be more intuitive.  For example, the decomposition stars in the
close packings are exactly 8 points (one point comes from each tetrahedron
around a fixed vertex).  The local formulation of the Kepler conjecture
asserts that every decomposition star scores at most 8 points.

<p><DT><B>Q<dd></B>

<DT>
Q-system
<dd>
A collection of nonoverlapping quarters in a packing is chosen according
to a rather elaborate set of rules.  These quarters together with
the quasi-regular tetrahedra in the packing form what is called a
Q-system.

<DT>
quad cluster
<dd>A standard cluster whose standard region is a quadrilateral.

<DT>
quarter
<dd>
A quarter is a simplex with five edges of length between 2 and 2.51
and a sixth of length between 2.51 and 2sqrt(2).  They are one of the
fundamental shapes used in the definition of a decomposition star.
A quasi-regular  octahedron with a diagonal of length between 2.51 and
2sqrt(2) breaks into four quarters along the diagonal.  This is the
origin of the term.  Yet if a quarter is distored sufficiently
it is possible to fit various numbers of quarters along a single edge.

<DT>
quasi-regular tetrahedron  
<dd>A tetrahedron is quasi-regular if
each edge has length between 2 and 2.51.

<p><DT><B>R<dd></B>

<DT>
rad(S)
<dd>See circumradius

<DT>
rho(x1,...,x6)
<dd>
rho is a polynomial used to express the circumradius of a simplex.
The circumradius squared of a simplex is rho/(4 Delta), expressed
as a function of the squares of the edge lengths of the simplex.

<DT>
Rogers simplex
<dd>
A Rogers simplex is a simplex with three edges meeting at right angles.
It is determined by the lengths of the three edges.  When we speak of
Rogers simplices in the context of sphere packings, we generally have in mind
particular three-dimensional pieces of a Voronoi cell.  The vertices
of the Rogers simplex are the center A of the sphere, the closest point
B on an edge to A, an endpoint C of the edge, and the closest point D
to A on a face containing the edge.  When the closest point isn't a
perpendicular, certain complications arise; but this is all handled
by Rogers.  We generally use coordinates R(a,b,c), for the Rogers simplex,
where a = d(A,D), b = d(A,B), c = d(A,C), with d(,) the distance.

<p><DT><B>S<dd></B>

<DT>
saturated packing.
<dd>  A packing of spheres of radius 1
is saturated if no point in space lies at a distance greater than
2 from some sphere center.   Every packing can be saturated by
adding additional spheres to empty regions of space.

<DT>
simplex
<dd>Simplices in three dimensions are assumed to be endowed with
a fixed ordering of edges 1..6.  The first three edges meet at
a vertex, often referred to as the origin.  The fourth, fifth, and
sixth edges are assumed to lie opposite the first, second, and third,
respectively.

<DT>
solid angle
<dd>  Every simplex is assumed to be equipped with a
distinguished vertex, which is often placed at the origin.  The
solid angle of a simplex, is the solid angle of the simplex at
the distinguished vertex.  Solid angles are measured in steradians.
sol(S) denotes the solid angle of the simplex S.

<DT>
standard region
<dd>  A standard region is a region in the unit sphere.
Take a sphere center of a packing, which we take to be the origin.
Let <IT>v_1,...,v_k</IT> be the sphere centers that have distance at
most 2.51 from the origin.  Project each edge <IT>(v_i,v_j)</IT> that has
length at most 2.51 down to an edge <IT>(p_i,p_j)</IT> on the unit sphere.
Two points <IT>p</IT> and <IT>p'</IT> on the unit
sphere are taken to lie in the interior of the same standard region, 
if a path can be traced from <IT>p</IT> to <IT>p'</IT> without crossing any of
the projected edges.  The standard region is taken to be the
closure, so that it includes the bounding edges <IT>(p_i,p_j)</IT>.

<DT>
standard cluster
<dd>  Let <IT>V</IT> be the subset of {v_1,...,v_k}
consisting of vertices lying over a fixed standard region.  The
set of sphere centers <IT>V</IT> together with information about how
they are grouped (into quarters in the Q-system, quasi-regular tetrahedra,
octahedra, etc.) form a standard cluster.  Each decomposition star
can be broken into its constituent standard clusters.  
Standard clusters are the smallest groupings of spheres that can
be easily studied in isolation from the rest of the packing.
(On occasion we break standard clusters into subclusters, but this
takes more work, and the subclusters are not as numerically stable
as standard clusters.)

<DT>
upright diagonal
<dd>
The longest edge of an upright quarter in the Q-system
is called an upright
diagonal.

<DT>
upright quarter
<dd>
If a quarter has a distinguished vertex, it is said to be upright
if the longest edge has an endpoint at the distinguished vertex.

<p><DT><B>V<dd></B>

<DT>
vertex 
<dd>The centers of the spheres of a sphere packing are generally
referred to as vertices.

<DT>
Voronoi cell or Dirichlet region
<dd>
The Voronoi cell around a sphere is the set of points closer to its
center than to any other center of a sphere in a packing.  If the
packing is saturated, then the Voronoi cells are bounded.
