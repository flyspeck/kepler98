<p>

The countdown clock started October 12, 1997.
At that time a list was made of all that remained, and 
27000 credits were allocated among the items, 
according to the perceived difficulty
of the item.  The clock estimates completion date by a linear extrapolation
from the starting date.  The distribution follows.

<hr>
Part III (4000 credits available).
	<UL>
	<LI>(1000) rigorous verification of hypotheses stated in the paper.
	<LI>(3000) the 18 remaining cases, including the numerical
			verification of the new inequalities that arise.
	</UL>
<p>
<hr>
Part IV (23000 credits available)
	<UL>
	<LI>(5000) Prove the Major Hypotheses of Sphere Packings IV.
	<LI>(6000) The hexagonal cases.
	<LI>(8000) The pentagonal cases.
		<UL>
		<LI>(2000) The production of an explicit finite list, based
			on numerically checked inequalities.
		<LI>(6000) Portion to be determined.
		</UL>
	<LI>(2000) Minor cases: octagons, heptagons, arrangements with
			the (1,0,1_5), or (5,0,1_5) vertices.
	<LI>(2000) Proof of the Minor Hypotheses.
	</UL>

The credits were determined by the perceived difficulty of completing
each part of the Kepler conjecture.  Of course, as things progress,
our judgements of the difficulty will change, but the credit allocations
will remain the same, making some credits more difficult to earn than
others.
