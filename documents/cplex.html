<H3>Linear Programming Resources for Sphere Packings</H3>

<p>

This project makes extensive use of linear programming to produce
bounds on the scores of various decomposition stars.  Any linear
programming package would do.  The programs that appear here are
for <a href="http://www.cplex.com">CPLEX</a>.  Various public
domain and home-grown LP solvers were tried, and none of them compare
favorably to this commercial package.

<p>
The data for the bounds is produced as follows.
<p>

<UL>
<LI> The planar graph archive applet generates graphs.
<LI> A short java program (<a href="../graph/tt.java">view code</a>) 
	converts it to a Mathematica format
<LI> A Mathematica program 
	(code <a href="cplex/MathToCplex.m">MathToCplex.m</a>) 
	takes the inequalities
	from Sphere Packings III and the graphs in Mathematica format and
	produces files containing the linear programming in the LP format
	of cplex.
<LI>CPLEX is run on each of the LP format files 
	(<a href = "cplex.lp300">sample input</a>) to produce a bound
	on the score of the decomposition stars with a given graph.
	You might want to view a <a href="cplex/lquad.log">sample</a> 
	(1.5 Meg) of the
	output produced from cplex. This sample is the output 
	of the LP session producing the bounds on the 1749 graphs that
	arise in Sphere Packings III.
<LI>A short <a href="cplex/getValues">sed utility</a> 
grabs the output from the CPLEX log file
	and formats it in a form that can be analyzed in Mathematica.
</UL>

<p>
If you want to get involved in this part of the project and do not
want to purchase CPLEX, it will be necessary to rewrite the file
MathToCplex.m to produce linear programming files in a format that
your linear programming package can understand.
