<TITLE>Kepler -- Serious Stuff for Discrete Geometers</TITLE>
<H3>Serious Stuff for Discrete Geometers</H3>

<H3>Postscript files of the proof.</H3>
  There are over 250 pages here in postscript.
<p>
The papers can also be obtained from the 
<a href="http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.MG">xxx archive</a>.
Just click on Hales and Ferguson.

One more paper,
<a href="recent.ps">Recent Progress on the Kepler Conjecture</a>,
 is not current and is not part of the proof, but it gives
useful background.

Much of the remaining material will be of interest to very few.  It
contains all of the computer code and output from various verifications
relating to the Kepler conjecture.  It is for the benefit of
those who want to
know the exact details of various verifications.

<H3>Linear Programming.</H3>
The package <a href="http://www.cplex.com">cplex</a> was used for
the linear programming.  I have links to about 3 gigabytes of cplex-format
linear programming files.
<UL>
<LI><a href="../linear/BASIC/basic.zip">The crude linear programs</a>
<LI>The batch files, cplex log files, and
	Mathematica-format summaries of the cplex sessions of the 
	<a href="../linear/BASIC/basic.zip">crude
	linear programs.</a>

<p>
<LI>The refined linear programs for 
<a href="../linear/SHORT/PENT/pentall.zip">
pentagons</a>,
<a href="../linear/SHORT/PENT/pentall.zip">
double pentagons</a>,
 and
the batch files, cplex log files, and 
<a href="../linear/SHORT/PENT/pentall.zip">summaries</a> of the cplex sessions
		for pentagons.<br>
A few 
cases required extra work.  These
are summarized in 
<a href="../linear/SHORT/PENT/pentall.zip">
log files</a> in a quasi-Mathematica format.<p>

<LI>The refined linear programs for 
<a href="../linear/SHORT/HEX/LP/hex.zip">
hexagons </a> and
the batch files, cplex log files, and 
<a href="../linear/SHORT/HEX/">summaries</a> of the cplex sessions
		for hexagons<br>
A few 
cases required extra work.  These
are summarized in 
<a href="../linear/SHORT/HEX/INDEX">
log files</a> in a quasi-Mathematica format.<p>

<p>
<LI>The refined linear programs for 
<a href="../linear/SHORT/HEPT/hept.zip">
heptagons</a> and
the batch files, cplex log files, and 
<a href="../linear/SHORT/HEPT/hept.zip">summaries</a> of the cplex sessions
		for heptagons

<p>
<LI>The refined linear programs for 
<a href="../linear/SHORT/OCT/oct.zip">
octagons</a> and
the batch files, cplex log files, and 
<a href="../linear/SHORT/OCT/oct.zip">summaries</a> of the cplex sessions
		for octagons
</UL>
<p>
There are three files in Mathematica format that generate the cplex-format
linear programming files.
<UL>
<LI><a href="../linear/MathToCplex.m">basic routines</a>
<LI><a href="../linear/MathToCplexExcept.m">exceptional region routines</a>
<LI><a href="../linear/MathToCplexPent.m">pentagonal region routines</a>
</UL>
The Mathematica format sed files were created by a 
<a href="../linear/SHORT/getAddValues">sed program</a>

<H3>Planar Maps</H3>
<p>
The planar maps were generated by a 
<a href="../graph/">java program</a>.  All the source code is
in that directory, and the archive is contained in a 
<a href="../graph/archive/">subdirectory.</a>
The planar
map generation menu is currently disabled in the applet.  To
enable this feature of the applet, change the boolean debugMode
to true in the file renderGraph.java and recompile.  
A menu will appear in the applet with the options III, quad, pent,
hex, hept, oct.  Selecting "quad" will generate all the planar
graphs with at most a quad.  The output is sent to the standard output
(the java console).  These generate thousands of planar maps and
take a while (several hours) to generate.
