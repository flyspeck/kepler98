gamma.cc is the main program to compile.
	oldmain() produced the output gamma.out2.
	This was moved to (nint) directory and renamed part3oData.cc
		after it was converted to a C++ code file.
	
	The part3oData.cc file lists the cases that need to be
	verified to prove the inequalities of III.4.2, oct cases.

	All but 18 of the 1132 cases went through without trouble.
	On 1/4/98, gamma.cc was modified to produce a finer subdivision
	of the remaining 18 cases.  The output is being directed
	to gamma.out3.

The sole purpose of the stuff in this directory is to
produce a finite collection of 6D inequalities that imply
the octahedral inequalities in Sphere Packings III.4.2.

Note/5/14/98.  The stuff in this directory goes with the
	interval version of the same found in the subdirectory interval/PART3OCT.
