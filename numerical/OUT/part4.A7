 Cfsqp numerical optimizer for Sphere Packings IV 

 The inequalities in the appendix are divided into 24 sections.
 Sections 1-24 are tested numerically here. 

 Select section number (1--24): 
 The inequalities are written in the form F>0.
 This program minimizes F subject to constraints.
 If the returned value is positive, the inequality passes the numerical check. 
 Each inequality is test with 80 random initial configurations.
