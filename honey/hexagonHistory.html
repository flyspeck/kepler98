<TI>Background on the Hexagonal Honeycomb conjecture</TI>


<hr>
In 1994, D. Weaire and R. Phelan improved on Lord Kelvin's candidate
for the least-area way to partition space into regions of unit volume.
Contrary to popular belief, even the planar question remains open.

Let T be a tile of unit area such that the plane may be tiled by
congruent copies of it.  Steinhaus asks if the perimeter length
of T is least when T is a regular hexagon.  More generally, if
the plane is tiled by bounded tiles, not necessarily congruent,
but all of a diameter of at least D0, say, does the regular hexagonal
tiling minimize the maximum (perimeter length of T)^2/(area of T)
taken over all tiles T in the tiling?
<p>
The 3-dimensional analog of this is likely to be challenging: What
is the tile T of unit volume and least surface area that permits a tiling
of R^3 by congruent copies of T?

Bees are not of a solitary nature, as eagles are, but are like human
beings...  They have three tasks: food, dwelling, toil; and the food
is not the same as the wax, nor the honey, nor the dwelling.
Does not the chamber in the comb have six angles, the same number
as the bee has feet?  The geometricians prove that this hexagon 
inscribed in a circular figure encloses the greatest amount of space.

In Book V Pappus takes up a topic not mentioned by Euclid, but
apparently discussed by the Athenian mathematician Zenodorus....
This topic is the isoperimetric problem: 
<I>Which plane figure of a
given perimeter encloses the largest area?  Which solid figure having
a given surface area encloses the largest volume?</I>  Pappus introduces
this problem with one of the most charming essays in the history of
mathematics, one that has frequently been excerpted under the title
<I>On the Sagacity of Bees</I>.  Pappus speaks poetically of the
divine mission of the bees to bring from heaven the wonderful nectar
known as honey, and says that in keeping with this mission they must
make their honeycombs without any cracks through which honey could be
lost.  Having also a divine sense of symmetry, the bees had to choose
among the regular shapes that could fulfill this condition, that is,
triangles, squares, and hexagons.  They chose the hexagon because a
hexagonal prism required the least material to enclose a given volume.

Book V [of Pappus] is largely devoted to <I>isoperimetry</I>, or the
comparison of the areas of figures having equal bounding perimeters
and of volumes of solids having equal bounding areas.  This book also
contains an interesting passage on bees and the maximum-minimum properties
of the cells of their honeycombs.

The Pappus Problem
<p>
Book V of the <I>Collection</I> was a favorite with later commentators,
for it raised the question of the sagacity of bees.  Inasmuch as
Pappus showed that of two regular polygons having equal perimeters
the one with the greater number of sides has the greater area, he concluded
that bees demonstrated some degree of mathematical understanding
in constructing their cells as hexagonal, rather than square or
triangular prisms.  The book goes into other problems of isoperimetry,
including a demonstration that the circle has a greater area, for
given perimeter, than does any regular polygon.  Here Pappus seems
to have been following closely a work <I>On Isometric Figures</I>
written almost half a millenium earlier by Zenodorus (ca. 180 B.C.),
some fragments of which were preserved by later commentators.

<hr>
Zenodorus wrote, at some date between (say 200 B.C. and A.D. 90,
a treatise ... <I>On isometric figures</I>.  A number of propositions
from it are preserved in the commentary of Theon of Alexandria on Book
I of Ptolemy's <I>Syntaxis</I>; and they are reproduced in Latin in
the third volume of Hultsch's edition of Pappus, for the purpose of
comparison with Pappus's own exposition of the same propositions at
the beginning of his Book V, where he appears to have followed 
Zenodorus pretty closely while making some changes in detail.

Book V. Preface on the Sagacity of Bees.
<p>
It is characteristic of the great Greek mathematicians that, whenever
they were free from the restraint of the technical language of
mathematics, as when for instance they had occasion to write a preface,
they were able to write in language of the highest literary quality,
comparable with that of the philosophers, historians, and poets.
We have only to recall the introductions to Archimedes's treatises
and the prefaces to the different Books of Apollonius's <I>Conics</I>.
Heron, though severely practical, is not exception when he has
any general explanation, historical or other, to give.  We have now
to note a like case in Pappus, namely the preface to Book V of the
<I>Collection</I>.  The editor, Hultsch, draws attention to the
elegance and purity of the language and the careful writing; the
latter is illustrated by the studied avoidance of hiatus.  The subject
is one which a writer of taste and imagination would naturally find
attractive, namely the practical intelligence shown by bees in selecting
the hexagonal form for the cells in the honeycomb.  Pappus does not
disappoint us; the passage is as attractive as the subject, and 
deserves to be reproduced.
<p>
`It is of course to men that God has given the best and the most
perfect notion of wisdom in general and of mathematical science in
particular, but a partial share in these things he allotted to some
of the unreasoning animals as well.  To men, as being endowed with
reason, he vouchsafed that they should do everything in the light of
reason and demonstration, but to the other animals, while denying them
reason, he granted that each of them should, by virtue of a certain
natural instinct, obtain just so much as is needful to support life.
This instinct may be observed to exist in the very many other species
of living creatures, but most of all in bees.  In the first place their
orderliness and their submission to the queens who rule in their state
are truly admirable, but much more admirable still their emulation,
the cleanliness they observe in the gathering of honey, and the
forethought and housewifely care they devote to its custody.  
Presumably because they know themselves to be entrusted with the
task of bringing from the gods to the accomplished portion of 
mankind a share of ambrosia in this form, they do not think it proper
to pour it carelessly on ground or wood or any other ugly and
irregular material; but, first collecting the sweets of the most
beautiful flowers which grow on earth, they make from them, for
the reception of the honey, the vessels which we call honeycombs,
(with cells) all equal, similar and contiguous to one another,
and hexagonal in form.  And that they have contrived this by virtue
of a certain geometrical forethought we may infer in this way.
They would necessarily think that the figures must be such
as to be contiguous to one another, that is to say, to have
their sides common, in order that no foreign material could enter
the interstices between them and so defile the purity of their
produce.  Now only three rectilineal figures would satisfy the
condition, I mean regular figures which are equilateral and
equiangular; for the bees would have none
of the figures which are not uniform... There being then three
figures capable by themselves of exactly filling up the space
about the same point, the bees by reason of their instinctive
wisdom chose for the construction of the honeycomb the figure
which has the most angles because they conceived that it would
contain more honey than either of the two others.
<p>
`Bees then, know just this face which is of service to themselves,
that the hexagon is greater than the square and the triangle and 
will hold more honey for the same expenditure of material used
in constructing the different figures.  We, however, claiming
as we do a greater share in wisdom than bees, will investigate a
problem of still wider extent, namely that, of all equilateral
and equiangular plane figures having an equal perimeter, that
which has the greater number of angles is always greater, and the
greatest plane figure of all those which have a perimeter equal
to that of the polygon is the circle.'

Chapter I The beginnings of geometry
<p>
The subject of geometry, whether we consider it as a science or 
an art, has a very long history.... What is the earliest example
of purposive geometrical construction.... If a pigeon fly straight
rather than on a curve, once it has decided the direction of its
home, we are safe in saying that it has intentionally taken
the shortest path and applaud its sagacity, without inquiring as to
whether the real reason was not that it had an impulse to go
straight, and none to bend....
<p>
Another example in Nature where great credit has been given for
geometrical sagacity is found in the cell-structure of the
honey bee.  Such a cell is a prism whose section is approximately
a regular hexagon, while the ends are three-faced `steeples'.
The cleverness of the creature in constructing a habitation of
hexagonal section excited the admiration of Pappus, some sixteen hundred
years ago:

<p>
[Heath's translation of Pappus is quoted here.]

<p>
But the bee's skill in solving problems in maxima and minima does not
end here.  It was found on examination that the angle formed by the
faces of the steeple with the axis was such as to make the total
surface for a given volume a minimum, a result experimentally determined
by MacLaurin.  What clever bees!

<p>
But were the really so clever?  Let us look at the matter more closely....

The Sagacity of the Bees in making their Cells of an hexagonal
Form, has been admired of old; and that Figure has been taken notice
of, as the best they could have pitched for their Purposes: But a
yet more surprising Instance of the Geometry of these little Insects
is seen in the Form of the Bases of those Cells, discovered in the
late accurate Observations of Monsieur Maraldi and Monsieur de
Reaumur, who have found those Bases to be of the Pyramidal Figure,
that requires the least Wax for containing the same Quantity of Honey,
and which has at the same time a very remarkable Regularity and
Beauty, connected of Necessity with its Frugality.

Much has been written on the this question of the geometry of the
honeycomb.  The bee's strange social habits and geometric talents
could not fail to attract the attention and excite the admiration
of their human observers and exploiters.  ``My house,'' says
the bee in the <I>Arabian Nights,</I> ``is constructed according
to the laws of a most severe architecture; and Euclid himself
could learn from studying the geometry of my cells.''  

<p>
Darwin ... spoke of the bees' architecture as ``the most wonderful
of known instincts'' and adds: ``Beyond this stage of perfection
in architecture natural section (which has replace divine guidance!)
could not lead; for the comb of the hive-bee, as far as we can see,
is absolutely perfect in economizing labor and wax.''

beautiful, is the bee's cell.

What Jeremy Taylor called ``the discipline of bees and the rare
fabric of honeycombs'' must have attracted the attention and excited
the admiration of mathematicians from time immemorial. ``Ma maison
est construite,'' says the bee in the <I>Arabian Nights,</I> 
``selon les lois d'une s&eacute;v&egrave;re architecture; et Euclidos
lui-m&ecirc;me s'instruirait en admirant la g&eacute;om&eacute;trie
de ses av&eacute;oles.''  Ausonius speaks of the <I>geometrica forma
favorum</I>, and Pliny tells of men who gave a lifetime to its study.
<p>
Pappus the Alexandrine has left us an account of its hexagonal plan,
and drew from it the conclusion that the bees were endowed with
``a certain geometrical forethought''.  ``There being, then, three
figures which of themselves can fill up the space round a point,
viz. the triangle, the square and the hexagon, the bees have wisely
selected for their structure that which contains the most angles, suspecting
indeed that it could hold more honey than either of the other two.''
[footnote:  This was according to the ``theorem of Zenodorus.''
The use by Pappus of ``economy'' as a guiding principle is remarkable.
For it means that, like Hero with his mirrors, he had a pretty clear
adumbration  of that principle of <I>minima</I> which culminated in
the <I>principle of least action,</I> which guided eighteenth-century physics,
was generalised (after Fermat) by Lagrange, inspired Hamilton and Maxwell,
and reappears in the latest developments of wave-mechanics.]

l'abeille a six pattes, explication na&iuml;ve qui se retrouve
chez Pline, ou bien occupation maximale de l'espace, id&eacute;e que
Kepler d&eacute;veloppera et que les zoologistes modernes semblent
admettre.  Les autres auteurs de l'Antiquit&eacute; se sont born&eacute;s
&agrave; dire que l'abeille sait la g&eacute;om&eacute;trie.
