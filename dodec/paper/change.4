< We will now prove lower bounds for the squander of a vertex based entirely on its type.  The following table gives obvious constraints on the sparse graphs.  For example, if more than 0.178 is squandered at a vertex of a given type, then that type of vertex cannot be part of a graph from a sparse graph whose volume is less than $\vol(D)$.  These relations between volumes and vertex types will allow us to reduce the feasible planar maps to an explicit finite list.  For each of the planar maps on this list, we calculate a second, more refined linear programming bound on the volume.  Often, the refined linear programming bound is greater than $\vol(D)$.
