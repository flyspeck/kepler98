1/1/98: Here are a few notes on the flow of the program.

excessTCount only shows up in pqrExcess, which in turn
	only shows up in ExcessAt, which is only in
	ExcessNotAt.

pqrExcess should issue an error message if called with exCount<=0,
	but currently we are using it correctly, so this isn't an error.

fixedSquanderVertex becomes squanderVertex and forecast (forecastD).
	squanderVertex and forecast show up in ExcessAt, hence in
	ExcessNotAt.  Otherwise when they are used they are used at
	a single fixed vertex, often in combination with ExcessNotAt(that vertex).
	
This note is motivated by an (unfounded) worry I had that the excess 
	in excessTCount get mingled with the fixedSquanderedVertex amounts
	even if they are not properly disjoint.  To see that this doesn't
	happen, note that since everything is being channeled through
	ExcessNotAt, the disjointness rules of that procedure are applied.
	That procedure allows any nonadjacent vertices except when they
	occur on the same quadrilateral.  This is indeed the correct
	rule to be using, so things are correct.
