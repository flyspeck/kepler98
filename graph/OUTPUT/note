Everything was rerun a (hopefully final) time on Feb 11, 1998.
I checked that everything was already in the archive.

invariant.java calculates the graph invariants.
These were fed into mathematica, and the invariants for the new graphs
were compared to the invariants in the archive.  An array was
made giving how each new graph should match with an old.  This
was placed in PENT.java,...,OCT.java.  These java programs verified
that each matching of invariants actually corresponded to a graph
isomorphism.

So nothing new was found.  (I thought there was one new pent, and
modified the archive, but then I realized it was there and changed
the archive/graphPENT.java back to how it was.)

I started this calculation late last night.  Pents finished around midnight.
Hexes ran in a couple of hours on "maya", the others finished quickly.
